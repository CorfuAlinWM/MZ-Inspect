</p>
<br />
<h2>rewards and benefits</h2>
<br />
<p>
  The benefits that are available to you through Moe’s Rewards Program are based
  on the number of "Points" that you earn. Members earn points when making
  purchases for dine-in, carry-out or online orders (excluding the purchase of
  gift cards, alcohol and catering) at participating Moe’s locations only. To
  receive points for a qualified purchase, scan the bar code on the receipt from
  your purchase with the built in scanner in the App or scan your smartphone at
  the time of purchase with the scanner at the check-out counter. Points will
  automatically be credited to your account for any qualifying online purchase.
  After this verification, the points to which you are entitled will be applied
  to your Program Account. You can track the points and Rewards you have already
  earned and that you may earn in the future by logging into your Program
  Account through the App. You will receive one (1) "Point" for each U.S. dollar
  spent, except during limited time promotions when Moe’s may offer "Bonus
  Points" on featured products and/or services. No partial Points will be earned
  for purchase amounts less than one (1) U.S. dollar, with $0.51 minimum
  check-in amount. When you earn 100 points, you will receive a $10 credit.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Earning Points towards Rewards: Social Media Sharing & Referral Bonuses
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Members can also receive 10 extra points for every friend they refer who joins
  the Moe’s Rewards Program and starts earning points. Referred friends earn 5
  points when they sign up with a member’s referral code. When a member’s friend
  signs up using the member’s referral code, the member receives the 10 points
  when their friend makes a purchase and scans their receipt to earn points.
</p>
<p>
  Referrals must be made directly through the platforms provided in the Invite
  Friends section of the App. Posting referral codes online is prohibited. Moe’s
  reserves the right to freeze and reset a member’s account or otherwise limit a
  member’s account privileges based on a violation of the referral program
  requirements.
</p>
<p>
  You can also share your Moe’s experience on your personal Facebook page
  through the App. You have the option to make your comment public, but please
  note that by making your comment public, we may re-use your comment on the
  official Moe’s Facebook page and/or other social media outlets.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Member Feedback & Surveys
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Members will have the ability to give immediate feedback about their visit to
  Moe’s, with the added ability to share their comments through their social
  network on Facebook. Members can also provide feedback through surveys, which
  allow us to quickly collect information directly from members who are using
  the App and regularly visiting our restaurants. By submitting feedback or
  participating in surveys, members can earn more points!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Exclusive Insider News & Special Offers</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Moe’s Rewards Program members will have access to exclusive ‘insider’
  information – including being one of the first to hear about select new menu
  items, special promotions, system-wide events, etc. Members will learn about
  Limited Time Offerings and special promotions through push notifications
  and/or emails sent through the Moe’s Rewards Program.

  LLC, and its parent or affiliated companies, subsidiaries, advertising and
  promotion agencies and third party fulfillment or judging agencies are not
  eligible to enter or win any Campaign prizes.  Each Campaign begins and ends
  on dates as announced on the App (“Campaign Period”). To participate in a
  specific Campaign, make a purchase at a Moe’s location during the Campaign
  Period and scan the QSR from the App at the register. Make as many purchases
  as you want during the Campaign Period to earn points. All check-in scans to
  earn Moe Rewards points must be made by 11:59 pm on the last day of the
  Campaign Period. You will receive 10 points for every $1.00 spent. Campaign
  prizes will vary during each Campaign and can be substituted at the sole
  discretion of Moe’s. APR of each prize awarded will be between $1.00 and
  $600.00. If a prize winner is a minor in his or her state of residence, the
  Prize will be awarded to the minor's parent or legal guardian and the parent
  or legal guardian will be required to complete, sign and return an Affidavit
  and Release, if applicable. Prize winners will be notified through the App at
  the email address used to establish their Account.

  <strong>General</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Your Rewards are not valid on the same transaction that earned the Points and
  are valid on the next visit only. If the purchase on which you use your Reward
  totals less than $7.00, then you will forfeit the remainder of the Reward; the
  Reward balance will not be kept in your Account. Rewards are valid for 60
  days. Once you earn a Reward, you may start accumulating points towards
  another Reward. You may only redeem one Reward per 4 hour period meaning that
  you may only redeem one Reward per visit regardless of the number of Rewards
  you have earned in your Account. A Reward may not be combined with any other
  offer or coupon. The Rewards you do not redeem will remain on your Account
  until you use them or until your annual anniversary in the Moe’s Rewards
  Program, whichever occurs first. At each anniversary date of becoming a member
  of Moe’s Rewards Program, your points will be reset and you will begin
  accruing points for the following year.

    binding dispute resolution and arbitration; class action waiver
  </strong>
</h2>
<br />
<p>
  <strong>
    Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights,
    INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Last Update to this Binding Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action
    Waiver Section: January 1, 2020
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    This Binding Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver
    Provision (the “Provision”) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution
    of any “dispute,” which includes any claim or controversy, whether based in
    contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort – including, but not limited
    to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence – or any
    other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability
    or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the
    Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and Moe’s that
    may arise out of or any way relate to your access of the App, your use of
    and participation in the Moe’s Rewards Program, any other Rewards program
    described in this Terms and Conditions, and/or this Agreement, including the
    validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of
    the Class Action Waiver provision below). Effectively, then, “dispute” is
    given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims
    against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to
    you (such as Moe’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors)
    whenever you also assert claims against Moe’s in the same proceeding.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    This Provision provides that all disputes between you and Moe’s shall be
    resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms and
    Conditions constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all
    opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. Moe’s prefers this because Moe’s
    believes arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear,
    there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration
    award is limited. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and Conditions and
    can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s
    fees). You may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means you would
    have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or
    jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by
    others (including, but not limited to, class actions). ALL PARTIES HERETO
    AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED
    ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE
    PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING
    ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

      <strong>pre-arbitration claim resolution</strong>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first
      give Moe’s an opportunity to resolve the Dispute which is first done by
      visiting
      <a href="https://www.mcalistersdeli.com/contact" class="fcs-third-party" target="_blank">www.mcalistersdeli.com/contact</a>
      and filling out the form: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) A written
      description of your claim, and (4) A description of the specific relief
      you seek. If Moe’s does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after
      receiving your notification, than you may pursue your Dispute in
      arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the
      circumstances described below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">
      <strong>exclusions from arbitration/right to opt out</strong>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the above, you or Moe’s may choose to pursue a Dispute in
      court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation
      in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
      WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS AND
      CONDITIONS (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt-out of this Provision by
      mailing Moe’s at Moe’s Franchisor SPV LLC, Attn: Legal Department, 5620
      Glenridge Drive, Atlanta, GA 30342: (1) Your name; (2) Your address; (3) A
      clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Moe’s
      through arbitration. Either way, Moe’s will not take any decision you make
      personally. In fact, Moe’s promises that your decision to opt-out of this
      Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship
      with Moe’s. But, Moe’s does have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep
      in mind that any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will
      not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small
      claims court.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">
      <strong>arbitration procedures</strong>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided
      above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Moe’s may initiate
      arbitration proceedings with either the American Arbitration Association
      (“AAA”),
      <a href="https://www.adr.org/" class="fcs-third-party" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>, or JAMS,
      <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" class="fcs-third-party" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. AAA or JAMS will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be
      conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced
      as an individual arbitration only, and shall in no event be commenced as a
      class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or
      arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including
      the scope of this Provision.
    </p>
    <p>
      For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s
      Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes that are in effect
      at the time the arbitration is initiated will apply; for Disputes
      involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules that are
      in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated will apply. In either
      instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection
      that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated shall apply.
      The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling <a href="tel:18007787879">1-800-778-7879</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &
      Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For
      Domestic, Commercial Cases that are in effect at the time the arbitration
      is initiated will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com
      or by calling <a href="tel:18003525267">1-800-352-5267</a>. This Provision governs in the event it
      conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances
      will class action or representative procedures or rules apply to the
      arbitration
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the Moe’s Rewards Program and these Terms and Conditions concern
      interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the
      arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply
      applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable
      statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Arbitration Award </strong> - The arbitrator may award on an
      individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable
      law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the
      benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator
      will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons
      unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law. Such award
      will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal
      provided by the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered in any
      court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
      You and Moe’s understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration
      provision, you and Moe’s would have the right to sue in court and have a
      jury trial. You and Moe’s further understand that, in some instances, the
      costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation in court and the
      right of discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Confidentiality of Arbitration Proceedings</strong> - Arbitration
      proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be strictly
      confidential. The fact that an arbitration exists or is proceeding,
      <em>the nature of the Dispute, all documents exchanged in connection with
        the arbitration, all testimony (including transcripts of testimony, if
        any) that is given in the arbitration proceeding, and any arbitration
        award shall remain confidential. The only exceptions to this
        confidentiality provision are disclosures reasonably necessary to
        confirm or vacate an arbitration award, a judicial challenge to an
        arbitration award or its enforcement, or disclosure that is required by
        operation of law or court order; provided, however, that this Paragraph
        shall not prevent the disclosure of such information (1) as may be
        required to your legal and financial advisors and independent
        accountants; (2) as may be required to any ME Entity’s (a) legal,
        financial and other professional advisors, regulators, rating agencies,
        independent accountants, analysts, agents, and/or directors, (b)
        shareholders and/or affiliates and their respective officers, directors
        and legal, financial and other professional advisors, and/or (c)
        existing or potential insurers or reinsurers, existing or potential
        investors, existing or potential lenders, or existing or potential
        purchasers; and/or (3) as otherwise required to comply with any
        applicable law or regulation.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Location of Arbitration</strong> - You or Moe’s may initiate
      arbitration in either Atlanta, Georgia or the Unites States county in
      which you reside. In the event that you select the county of your United
      States residence, Moe’s may transfer the arbitration to Atlanta, Georgia
      in the event it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a
      result of the change in the arbitration location as determined by the
      arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs </strong> - So long as you
      place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, Moe’s
      will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any
      arbitrator's hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written request to
      the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the
      arbitration. But, you will still be responsible for all additional fees
      and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include but are not
      limited to attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses, unless Moe’s is otherwise
      specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. In addition
      to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if you provide
      notice and negotiate in good faith with Moe’s as provided in the section
      above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator
      concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will
      be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined
      by the arbitrator.

    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS YOUR
        LEGAL RIGHTS. Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the
        arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may
        not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative
        proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action,
        representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both
        you and Moe’s specifically agree to do so in writing following
        initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in
        court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above,
        this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any
        other participant in the Moe’s Rewards Program can be a class
        representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,
        consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with

        a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court, to the fullest
        extent allowed by law. In the absence of this Provision, you and Moe’s
        might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a
        court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented
        in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as
        otherwise provided below, those rights are waived. Other rights that you
        would have if you went to court (e.g., the rights to both appeal and
        certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.

      clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be
      severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and
      effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or
      unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute
      will be decided by a court and you and McAlisters’ each agree to waive in
      that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury as
      set forth above.

      Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms and Conditions to the
      contrary, Moe’s agrees that if Moe’s makes any change to this Provision
      (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such
      change and require Moe’s to adhere to the present language in this
      Provision if a dispute between the parties hereto arises.
